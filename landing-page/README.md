## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

Things To Do.
1) Basically I have to change this static project into dynamic. 
2) I have to create navbar by using java script and make it responsive and active.
3) Add some style which shows your current visiting section.
4) navbar will navigate between different sections smoothly.
